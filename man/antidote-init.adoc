== Name
antidote-init - initialize the shell for dynamic bundles

== Synopsis
`source <(antidote init)`

== Description
*antidote-init* changes how the *antidote* command works by causing *antidote bundle* to automatically source its own output instead of just generating the Zsh script for a static file.

This behavior exists mainly to support legacy antigen/antibody usage. Static bundling is highly recommended for the best performance. However, dynamic bundling may be preferable for some scenarios, so you can rely on this functionality remaining a key feature in *antidote* to support users preferring dynamic bundles.

Typical usage involves adding this snippet to your `.zshrc` before using `antidote bundle` commands:

----
source <(antidote init)
----

== Options
*-h, --help*:: Show the help documentation.
